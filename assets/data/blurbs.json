  "U.S. Wyoming WC": {
    "description": "A light, sweet oil from the Niobrara play in central Wyoming, a U.S. state. WC’s gas-to-oil ratio is among the highest of the OCI Phase 2 sample oils, and its gas is composed of heavier hydrocarbons like ethane and butane, requiring processing that both is energy intensive and entails occasional venting. WC’s venting and flaring emissions are thus among the highest of U.S. oils in the sample, though they are offset in part by natural gas that is captured upstream and exported. WC (also identified as Wyoming Sweet) is one of the OCI Phase 2 oils whose price is tracked and reported monthly. OCI assay source: Wyoming Sweet, Crude Oil Analysis Database"

  "U.S. Texas Yates": {
    "description": "A light, sour, depleted crude from the Permian basin in west Texas, a U.S. state, that has been in production for over ninety years. Though enhanced oil recovery techniques are used to extract Yates, these do not greatly contribute to its emissions intensity. Yates (also identified as West Texas Sour) is one of the OCI Phase 2 oils whose price is tracked and reported monthly. OCI assay source: West Texas Sour, Stratiev"

  "U.S. California Wilmington": {
    "description": "A heavy, sour oil located in southern Los Angeles County. Running pumps to extract this watery, depleted crude from the reservoir generates Wilmington’s upstream GHG emissions. Petcoke is produced when this heavy oil is refined. When exported and combusted, the petcoke contributes significantly to Wilmington’s downstream GHG emissions.  OCI assay source: Wilmington, Knovel"

  "Venezuela Hamaca SCO ": {
    "description": "An extra-heavy, sour oil produced in the Orinoco heavy-oil belt in central Venezuela. Hamaca’s upstream GHG emissions are high because it is upgraded into a synthetic crude oil (SCO) before it is refined. Hamaca is also produced in a highly developed, carbon-rich (forested) ecosystem, and elevated GHG emissions are released from the soil and from biomass when sites are developed for drilling. OCI assay source: Hamaca, Knovel"
  },
  "Venezuela Merey Blend ": {
    "description": "A 60/40 blend of extra-heavy, sour oil from the Orinoco heavy-oil belt and light Santa Barbara oil. The Merey Blend’s upstream GHG emissions are high due to the steam used to extract the viscous oil and the land-use disruption to the surrounding carbon-rich soil and biomass when drilling sites are developed. Heat and hydrogen are required to refine the oil, and petcoke is produced in the process; both of these factors contribute to Merey’s high emissions. The Merey Blend is one of the OCI Phase 2 oils whose price is tracked and reported monthly. This oil is blended to facilitate transport and is not equivalent on a per-barrel basis to conventional and synthetic oils in the OCI. OCI assay source: Merey, Oil & Gas Journal"
  },
  "Venezuela Tia Juana ": {
    "description": "An extra-heavy, sour oil from the vicinity of Lake Maracaibo. Tia Juana’s upstream GHG emissions result from land-use disruption and steam-based enhanced oil recovery techniques during its extraction. Refining emissions are high due to the hydrogen production this extra-heavy oil requires and the combustion of petcoke that process generates. OCI assay source: Tia Juana, Stratiev"
